# ALX-Data
This is my ALX-Udacity Data Analytics repository
The dataset was somewhat comprehensive in terms of the different features it had. When I further read about what goes into ensuring the success of a movie, I realized that perhaps some data points could have been captured or included in this dataset. In the dataset, the following columns were listed:

id
imdb_id
popularity
budget
revenue
original_title
cast
homepage
director
tagline
Keywords
Overview
runtime
genres
production_companies
release_date
vote_count
vote_average
release_year
budget_adj
revenue_adj
It would be interesting to find out if any of these data points have a bearing on the success of the movie. The substratum of the success of a movie for this project will be defined by the revenue it generates vis-a-vis all the other elements namely budget,cast, popularity, director, runtime, and production_companies. We shall also explore if these variables have an influence on each other. The other aspect we want to explore if one variable has the sole influence on the success of a movie or whether it's a collection of features that determine the success of a movie. Overall, I feel we should be able to answer a few questions as listed below.

Question(s) for Analysis

For this exercise, these are the questions we are going to explore from the data provided:

Does budget alone have a direct influence on the revenue and any other features? Here, we shall be exploring whether the budget has any bearing on the revenue generated from the movie. The anaylsis to be done will question whether having a big budget guarantees high revenue returns and vice versa. We shall also attempt to determine to what degree this influence is by examining the correlation between the two variables.
What other elements could be key to a movie generating more revenue? Based off the out findings from question one, we now want to explore what other features could have an influence on the revenue of a movie. We shall be examining the individual relationships between revenue and cast, popularity, director, production_companies. For the cast, we want to see if the top cast actors have been in the most successful movies or check which cast members have been in the most successful movies and compare with them the least cast members or least successful movies. In extension, we shall also check which directors have been involved in the most successful movies and what production companies they've worked with. All these factors will be compared to the revenue generated from the movies they've been involved in.
